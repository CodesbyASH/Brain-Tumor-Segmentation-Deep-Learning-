# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Deep-Learning-


üìåOverview

This project utilizes **deep learning and image processing techniques** to classify and segment brain tumors from MRI scans. Built using the **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset from Kaggle**, it detects four tumor classes: **glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor**. The pipeline includes **image preprocessing, CNN-based classification**, and **K-means-based segmentation** to visually localize tumor areas.



üéØObjectives

- Classify MRI images into one of four categories.
- Segment the tumor region within the scan.
- Apply robust preprocessing techniques to improve model performance.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, loss, and F1-score.

Image Processing Pipeline

 1. Preprocessing
- **Resizing** all images to `128*128`
- **Normalization** to scale pixel values between 0‚Äì1
- **Windowing** for enhancing soft tissue contrast
- **Histogram Analysis** for intensity distribution
- **Metadata Handling** using DataFrames for analysis (voxel size, scan quality)

 2. **Data Augmentation**
- Rotation
- Horizontal/Vertical flipping
- Brightness adjustments
- Zooming/scaling

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

Activation: ReLU + Softmax

Epochs: 20


 Segmentation Approach
K-means Clustering (k=2): Segment MRI images into tumor vs non-tumor regions based on intensity.

Morphological Operations: Erosion, dilation to refine segmentation.

Final output: Overlay mask on original scan.
